### Overview

Welcome to `Ji Yoon's & MarianaÂ´s sentiment analysis project`, 
here you will be able to find everythong related to our Initial Project Report 
(so far) inlcuiding datasets and the first attempts we will be implementing
in order to perform a tweet sentiment analysis on tweets related to `Covid19`.

### Dataset
The Data set is from Aman Miglani (Coronavirus tweets NLP - Text Classification: Corona Virus Tagged Data) 

### Steps
The steps we are planning to take are the following ones:

#### Initial Project report
1. Search and load necessary libraries
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Tweet pre-processing
4. Exploratory data analysis
  +  Here we want to explore the distribution of the tags in the training and the test data sets
  +  If possible, to plot the evolution of sentiments through time
5. Tokenization

#### Final Project report

6. Model Construction
  + Defining embedding dimension
  + Building sequential neural network
  + Compiling and training model
  + Evaluate model
  + Calculate and plot confusion matrix
  + Print Clasification report
7. Analysis of key findings
8. Final Presentation
